# Commit Message Generator

Analyse the current staged changes and generate a conventional commit message.

## Workflow
1. Run `git diff --cached --stat` to see which files changed
2. Run `git diff --cached` to see the actual diff content
3. Determine commit type: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf
4. Write subject line in imperative mood, max 72 characters
5. Add body paragraph explaining WHY the change was made

## Output Format
Output the commit message as plain text, ready to paste into git commit -m.
Never wrap in a code block.
