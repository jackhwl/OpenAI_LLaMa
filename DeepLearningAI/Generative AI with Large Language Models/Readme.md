## Week 1:
* Generative configuration:
* * greedy vs random sampling
* * top K: select an output from the top-k results after applying random-weighted strategy using the probabilities
* * top p: select an output using the random-weighted strategy with the top-ranked consecutive results by probability and with a cumulative probability <=p, [0,1]
* * Temperature: Cooler temperature (<1) strongly peaked probability distribution; Higher temperature (> 1) Broader, flatter probability distribution
