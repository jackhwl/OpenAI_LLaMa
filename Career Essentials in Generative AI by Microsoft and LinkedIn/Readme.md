### 1. What is Generative AI?
* A model is a set of algorithms that have been trained on a specific dataset.
### 2. Main Models
* Natural language models: GPT
* Text to Image Generiation Services: Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
* * Industrial applications: Cuebric, 
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GAN models work together to improve the generator's ability to create realistic data.
* VAE and Anomaly Detection
* * Variational Autoencoders (VAE) use anomaly detection
### 3. The Future of AI
* Future predictions
